# README.jeffrey 

Thoughts I've pulled together about how best to work with me.

This is meant to be digested by people with whom I work closely, and especially by people who report to me.

---

### Read this document to

- (re-)familiarize yourself with me as a human being.
- understand what you should (and shouldn't) expect from me.
- get a sense of my values, particularly in a work context.

---

### About Me

- I live in Berkeley, CA
  - with my wife (Senay), daughter (Naya), and son (Koa).
- I've lived in the Bay Area for more than 20 years.
- I prefer being outside to inside, _almost always_.
- I've been involved in the creation of software products for more than 35 years (yes, really).

---

### Why Splunk?

- The business opportunity is _huge_.
- The tech is really ambitious.
- Splunk is full of passionate, hyper-intelligent people.
- It's one of the most family-supportive organizations I've ever known.

---

### My job is to

- attract, hire, and retain world-class talent.
- enable amazing products to be delivered autonomously, by
  - relaying and / or setting context.
  - removing as many obstacles as I can.
- steward a high-performance engineering culture, and especially a high-degree of [psychological safety](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html).

**PLEASE let me know** if this doesn't line-up with your day-to-day experience of working with me.

---

### My Working Assumptions

- _You are better at your job than I am._
  - But, I might challenge and probe your work, anyway. This is one of the ways I "gather context" (see previous slide).
- _You feel safe disagreeing with and challenging me._
  - The sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner weâ€™ll trust and respect each other more.
- _You mean well._
  - Stressful times yield stressful conversations. I'll do my best to not take things personally.

---

### All feedback is a gift

- The three requirements for free-flowing feedback are:
  - **Safety**: there should be no retaliation or punishment for giving feedback.
  - **Low Effort**: it should be easy to deliver, with no rebuttals.
  - **Positive Effect**: it should materially impact behavior (i.e., be worth the effort).

**PLEASE** give me feedback on how well I'm delivering on these 3 dimensions.

---

### About 1:1s

If we work closely together, we'll have a regularly-occuring (typically weekly) 1:1. I'll provide a shared agenda we can co-maintain together.

#### If I am your manager, the 1:1 is _your_ time:
- _Don't_ use the time for status updates (unless you _really_ want / need to).
- I will assume that anything we discuss is confidential, unless otherwise disclosed.

---

### Need my time?

- Find me on Slack and ask for a quick chat; maybe we can do it _right now_. If not, let's schedule something.
- Put something on my calendar.  You don't need my permission.
- Don't wait for a 1:1, particularly if it's something tactical or urgent.

---

### Transparency

- I am biased toward openness and transparency.
- There may be times when I am _not_ at liberty to be open / transparent; sorry about that.
- Even when I am constrained from full transparency, I am committed to _not_ lying to you.

---

### Gotchas

- My belief system is strongly biased toward evidence. Therefore:
  - I am occasionally overly-dismissive when evidence is inconclusive.
  - This also leads toward a bias toward action and away from debate, e.g., "Let's just try X and see what happens."
    - (People who thoroughly enjoy long debates have been known to find this downright _maddening_.)
- Sometimes I try to deliver a "dry" joke, and it's missed.
  - If something I say is upsetting, please let me know and I'll do my best to clean it up.
- Sometimes my mouth moves faster than my brain. As such:
  - Please assume the best of me, but ...
  - Don't let me off the hook for irresponsible (or worse) communication.
